For a super short simple website with only one h1 tag with "Fabian was here", we will need the following files:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of the application. It will contain the Flask application and the route for the home page.
2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML template for the home page. It will contain the h1 tag with "Fabian was here".
3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the application to run.

Here are the contents of each file:

app.py
